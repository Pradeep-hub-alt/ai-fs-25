      The Garni Temple is a classical colonnaded structure in the village of
      Garni, in central Armenia, around 30 km (19 mi) east of Yerevan. Built in
      the Ionic order, it is the best-known structure and symbol of
      pre-Christian Armenia. It has been described as the "easternmost building
      of the Greco-Roman world" and the only largely preserved Hellenistic
      building in the former Soviet Union. It is conventionally identified as a
      pagan temple built by King Tiridates I in the first century AD as a temple
      to the sun god Mihr (Mithra). It collapsed in a 1679 earthquake, but much
      of its fragments remained on the site. Renewed interest in the 19th
      century led to excavations in the early and mid-20th century. It was
      reconstructed in 1969â€“75, using the anastylosis technique. It is one of
      the main tourist attractions in Armenia and the central shrine of Hetanism
      (Armenian neopaganism). This aerial photograph shows the Garni Temple in
      the winter.
